This program takes information from a text file, finds the frequency of the items in that file and can display how many of each item in a list format, state how many of a specific item is found in the text file, and can create a histogram showing the frequency of each item. 

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:

The program organizes a list of items sold at a fictional local grocery store, that are stored in a text file. I used Python code to read and count the items found in the text file to create a list of the items and how many of each item were sold, and to create a histogram visualizing the amount of each items sold. C++ code was utilized for the user interface and menu giving the user options to show a list of all the times and how many were sold, to show how much of a specific item was sold, and to show them a visual representation of the items that were sold, or to exit the program.

What did you do particularly well:

I think my Python side of the program was done quite well. The C++ side was relatively minimal as it was mostly used for the menu and UI so nothing truly challenging was done there. I was able to succesfully write code that would read from a text file, make that information available to be called upon by C++, and create a .dat file. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on:

I think the program would be better if I could have implemented a trend where the user could see what their best selling items were and possibly on what days so they could better handle their inventory. I think for this a database might be more useful so it could store data from a days inventory across multiple years. I also imagine it would be much more secure than a text file. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network:

I initially ran into issues where my code would output a single item multiple times with different values. A quick google search helped me realize what I was doing wrong and was able to easily fix it. Another issue I ran into was if a user entered an item in all lowercase the program wouldn't be able to search for the item and produce an error. I realized I had to convert the items on the list into lowercase in the instance the user used all lowercase characters instead of uppercase. 


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work:

Being able to succesfully integrate multiple languages together is a great skill to have and I think will be quite helpful in the future where I can use different languages strenghts together to create a stronger more efficient program. Having good error handling is another great skill that will be useful as it can help troubleshoot and debug your own code as I had to do with figuring out if a user used all lowercase letters to search for an item when the items listed have the first character capitalized. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable:

I made sure to use comments to explain what the function was meant to perform and where the code may be pulling information from. I also utilized organization and spacing to ensure the code wasn't a jumbled mess and each function could easily be located and separated from other functions. And also used proper formatting to ensure the code is readable and if I ever wanted to change a function or enhance a function I could easily do so.
